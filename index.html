            <P> <b>Buddhism is the second oldest religion in Indonesia after Hinduism, which arrived from India around 
               the second century.[10] The history of Buddhism in Indonesia is closely related to the history of Hinduism,
               as a number of empires influenced by Indian culture were established around the same period. The oldest Buddhist 
               archaeological site in Indonesia is arguably the Batujaya stupas complex in Karawang, West Java. The oldest relic 
               in Batujaya was estimated to originate from the 2nd century, while the latest dated from the 12th century. 
               Subsequently, significant numbers of Buddhist sites were found in Jambi, Palembang and Riau provinces in Sumatra, 
               as well as in Central and East Java. The Indonesian archipelago has, over the centuries, witnessed the rise and 
               fall of powerful Buddhist empires, such as the Sailendra dynasty, the Mataram and Srivijaya empires.
               According to some Chinese source, a Chinese Buddhist monk I-tsing on his pilgrim journey to India,
               witnessed the powerful maritime empire of Srivijaya based on Sumatra in the 7th century. A number of Buddhist 
               historical heritages can be found in Indonesia, including the 8th century Borobudur mandala monument and Sewu 
               temple in Central Java, Batujaya in West Java, Muaro Jambi, Muara Takus and Bahal temple in Sumatra, and numerous
               of statues or inscriptions from the earlier history of Indonesian Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms.</P>
